## ev4 non-nerd summary

Instead of adding more lore n stuff (besides giving the first_choice yes option code but it just plays music and moves to the keypad thing) I added : **THE OPTIONS MENU**

2 new options related to save slots and 1 volume control. Besides the other thing thats about it for content.

Oh wait, uh.

The fake ending now can say one of multiple things :
- `Cheater Cheater Meater Beater`
- `Cheater Cheater Pussy Eatter`
- `Cheater Cheater Pumpkin Eatter`

And other small things here and there

There's a new system in place for music tracks legit called : "MusicMan" that allows intros to music tracks.
States can now independently control if the cursor is active in the current state (default : false), with the transitions and the version disappearing also? That's no more and there is now sorting for the version to be on top (hopefully? It looked like it but I can't really tell LOL.)

Save data has changed location slightly, the save class in general had alot of work put into it, some code cleanup was done...

And that's about it!
