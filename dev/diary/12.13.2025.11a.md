# December 13th, 2025 : 11am

I've been up since 5a (5 am) and I hadn't at until 10a.

Is there something wrong with me lol?

## ev3 summary

So for ev3 it was me adding the first choice and the keypad scene, the start of... I dunno... the "no" route?

I don't have this planned out in the slightest except for ideas for what I wanna do next.

First version with images, that's an achievement LOL.

I fixed imagePath and dataPath in AssetPaths, for the images specifically they were returning .png.wav's which was funny to me lol.

2 new music tracks:

- `thereAreNoWrongOptions`
- `butYouPickedTheWorstOption`

I feel like this is relatable right? You're told there are no wrong answers but then when you answer they basically are like "that's wrong you IDIOT."

There is now a "Pettiness" error. It's just me being petty LOL cause there's now `PathState` which sets the save's gameplay path so I won't have to worry about it when switching scenes.

I think I've really liked making music (even if simple or bad) for this game cause of how I started making the game because of a music video I was watching ([This video specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHjYofV0uVM&t=449s)).

## draw.io

I'm usin draw.io to just be able to view the progression (I called it gameplayOutline but that makes no sense) slash timeline of the game. And that's about it.
