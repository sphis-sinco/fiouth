## rv1 plan

I've now got a plan for rv1 (Release Version 1), it's small so I ***can*** do it. But I think it'll be enough content for an early version of the game.

2 paths that will be explored in rv2, and a 2 endings not including those where you're just dead, lol.

So 4 total endings, 2 which will be continued, 2 not. (Maybe?)

So yeah, that's it for this Diary
