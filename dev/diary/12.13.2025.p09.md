Holy shit man.

Making a game and life...

Balacing those, that feeling.

I've forgot it.

But I still... love it.

I haven't really gotten to make a game for this long in a bit.

I'm starting to question why I'm still doing this.
My only real answer is that I just really want to finally.

I wanna make a game, people may or may not play it but that's fine.

I made it.

I'll like it.
