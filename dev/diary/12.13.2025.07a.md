Holy shit, adding this one easter egg where you change your save to "end" and then will get
a fake ending that makes fun of you is hard.

I'm having SO many issues with the save because I'm modifying a .sol file which I don't even know the formatting for
and either way the solution ended up being to just do with the backup parser in `FlxG.save.bind` return the `getDefault()`
function I have.

But it works now.

Stupid solution or not.

Stupid EASTER EGG or not.

It was worth it LOL. I haven't had such a rush in programming in a while. It feels refreshing.

## For github ppl
Changed the file format to markdown so I can post these on discord and get formatting
